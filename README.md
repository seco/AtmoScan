**AtmoScan** is a multisensor device that measures:

* Temperature
* Humidity
* Pressure
* CO2
* CO
* NO2
* Air Quality
* PM 01
* PM25
* PM10
* PM 01
* Radiation

It integrates a number of open source libraries and leverages internet web services .
It has an LCD color display, it is gesture controled and it posts to ThingSpeak (or others) via MQTT, but can properly handle disconnected operations. With a rechargeable battery it lasts a day when disconnected.

I started buiding the software with a proper framework in mind... but never had the time to properly finish it the way i started, so i quickly completed it with way too many hacks. Therefore code could be way better. If anyone is interested in contributing, it is welcome.

Should anyone be interested, i can publish BoM, schematics etc and describe it. I still have 9 PCB that i am happy to give away at nominal price or less.
